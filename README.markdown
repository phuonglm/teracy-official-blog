====================

Teracy's official blog at http://blog.teracy.com


How to start
------------

Follow the instruction here at
http://blog.teracy.com/2013/08/03/how-to-start-blogging-easily-with-octopress-and-teracy-dev/

Instead of cloning `octopress` repository, fork this repository into your github account and
clone it into your personal workspace.

1. Fork this repository into your github account

2. Clone your forked repository into your `workspace/personal` directory:

``` bash
$ ws
$ cd personal
$ git clone <your_forked_repository_here>
```

How to run blog on teracy-dev vagrant box
-----------------------------------------

1. Setup dev VM like this: http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html

2. Enable Ruby: http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/ruby_training.html

3. Forward port 4000 for vagrant_config_override.json

```
  "vm_forwarded_ports":[
    {
      "guest": 4000,
      "host": 4000
    }
    ...
```

4. Install dependency, clone this repository and preview

After `$ vagrant ssh`:

4.1. Install with `bundle`

Installs this for the first time only

```
$ ws
$ git clone <repo_url>
$ cd personal/blog
$ bundle install
```

4.2. Preview blog

```
$ ws
$ cd personal/blog
$ rake preview
```

You should see something like this:

```

Dear developers making use of FSSM in your projects,
FSSM is essentially dead at this point. Further development will
be taking place in the new shared guard/listen project. Please
let us know if you need help transitioning! ^_^b

Now, open http://localhost:4000 to see the blog.

Note that sometimes the content was cached, you need to stop the preview (Cmd/Ctrl + c) then
`$ rake generate` and `$ rake preview` again.
